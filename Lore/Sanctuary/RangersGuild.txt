THE RANGERS GUILD

The rangers guild is known for being able to hide anywhere they are. Their favored
weapon is the bow, but they do use other weapons. Not just anyone can become a ranger,
to become a ranger one has to come to you and offer to train you as a ranger. It can
take up to 20 years to finish your training to be a ranger so many people never finish
their training because they are not patient enough.
